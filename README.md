# Short-term Load Forecasting Method of Smart Grid using DNN and LSTM

This project presents a hybrid forecasting method leveraging Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to improve the accuracy of short-term load forecasting in smart grids. The proposed approach captures both non-linear relationships and temporal dependencies in load data, ensuring more reliable energy distribution and grid stability.


# Abstract

In the evolving landscape of smart grids, accurate short-term load forecasting is critical for energy optimization. Our approach integrates DNNs for feature learning and LSTMs for sequence modeling, improving prediction accuracy. Preprocessing techniques such as normalization and decomposition enhance data quality. The hybrid model achieves robust forecasting by combining static and dynamic aspects of the data.
